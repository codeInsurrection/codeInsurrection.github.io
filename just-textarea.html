<html>
  <body>
    <textarea style='width: 20rem; height: 20rem;'>
      This is a text area. Search for terms in here doesn't seem to ever work. One, Two, Three. One, two, three or one, two three.
      Some JS like text 
      test.#getResult();

      And another couple of instances of tone bone iPhone.

    </textarea>
    <br>
    And this is not text in a textarea. Now done.
  </body>
